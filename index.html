            <p class="p-graph">I have one fantastic husband, two gorgeous children, three noisy chickens and the most adorable, sweet, rescue black lab. I’m lucky enough to live in a great village and have a job I actually enjoy. have always loved food and cooking. Some of my earliest memories are of poring over cookbooks then making pudding on a Sunday with Dad. My Mum is a product of the 1970’s health food movement and I was brought up eating things my friends had never even heard of. The eternal request in our house when having friends over for dinner was ‘can we have something normal please?’. To be fair, she wasn’t helped by the fact that between us (myself and my three siblings) she had to contend with wheat, milk, corn and glucose intolerances. But don’t worry, you won’t find any recipes for tapioca cooked in red grape juice here.</p>
