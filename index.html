            <p class="p-graph">I have one fantastic husband, two gorgeous children, three noisy chickens and the most
                adorable, sweet, rescue black lab. I’m lucky enough to live in a great village and have a job I actually
                enjoy. have always loved food and cooking. Some of my earliest memories are of poring over cookbooks
                then making pudding on a Sunday with Dad. My Mum is a product of the 1970’s health food movement and I
                was brought up eating things my friends had never even heard of. The eternal request in our house when
                having friends over for dinner was ‘can we have something normal please?’. To be fair, she wasn’t helped
                by the fact that between us (myself and my three siblings) she had to contend with wheat, milk, corn and
                glucose intolerances. But don’t worry, you won’t find any recipes for tapioca cooked in red grape juice
                here.</p>

        <p class="p-graph">Chicken fry is something that any household with a carnivores family would hog on. I mean I
            could fry a pot full and still see it empty. When compared to curried chicken that takes time to move out,
            fried chicken is always welcome. </p>
